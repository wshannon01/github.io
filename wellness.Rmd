## __Nutrition & Culinary Medicine__

During my first year of medical school at Johns Hopkins, I established the __Nutrition in Medicine (NiM) Interest Group and the Teaching Kitchen__ to empower students with practical nutrition and culinary knowledge to counsel patients on healthy dietary practices.

We created the __B’more Healthy Cookbook__ to promote healthy eating in the Baltimore community. Our group was selected to participate in the 2015-16 cohort of __Johns Hopkins University’s Social Innovation Lab__ to develop community cooking and nutrition classes.
